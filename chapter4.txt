It was the time of UFOs, it was the time of little green men.

Then, one of the spaceships, one that looked to have mechanical probleem of somo sort, crashed onto one of the major buildings in Guadalajara;
even when the crash was a whole dissaster, two little green guys descended from the spaceship completely unharmed. When the autorities arrived to
the scene, they discovered that the green called themselves Danny and Jonnhy, and both had discovered beer on their interglactic travel to our
world when they tried to abduct two earthlings named Danny and Jonnhy, whith whom the aliens got wasted because they were very funny guys. And thought it would be a good idea to take the names of their intergalactic friends to better fit into the population.

It was the first recorded alien drunk incident in the history of human kind.
